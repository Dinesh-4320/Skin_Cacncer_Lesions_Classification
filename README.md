# Skin_Cancer_Lesions_Classification
 Skin cancer is fatal of all cancers and had been a greatest challenge in the field of dermoscopy. Different pigments will form based on the underlying affected cells, which has to be examined and treated appropriately. Incorrect Diagnosis of different skin lesions may lead to lethal condition. This project showcases an approach to  design a deep learning model that uses CNN (Convolution Neural Network) to ideally classify various skin cancer lesions into 7 different classes. This project provides an exploratory data analysis on the **HAM10000 dataset**, then the challenge of imbalance between the classes of data was tackled using oversampling technique.. We compare traditional CNN trained from scratch and pretrained **ResNet-152V2** model to infer the difference in the detection results. As a inference of it we used CNN model to classify the lesions which achieved the accuracy of 97%. Then the weights from the imageNet is loaded the ResNet152V2 and classification is performed which resulted in accuracy of 95%.
